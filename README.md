# WarDriving
How a Raspberry Pi Could Ruin Your Life

## Introduction
  While the term may sound suspicious or ominous, Wardriving is simply the act of searching and mapping wireless access points. While it is not illegal to scan access points, it is illegal to steal or cause a denial of service so be sure to research your local laws and ordinances before undertaking this project.
